Goal:
I want to build an automated resume builder using LLMs and AI-based strategies that takes a job description (initially for the tech industry) and generates an optimized "Skills", "Work Experiences", and "Projects" section for a gold-standard resume.

The system should:

Extract key skills and requirements from the job description (plain text).

Generate FANNGs like "Skills", "Work Experiences", and "Projects" sections that passes ATS filters, Following instructions from a resume guidebook I provide.

Eventually, we’ll expand this for non-tech jobs — but for now, focus on tech roles, AI, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, machine learning scientist, etc.


Create a high-level project plan with clear milestones for the following modules:
Module 1: Job Description Analyzer
Purpose: Extract keywords and requirements from a pasted Job Description (JD).

Features:

paste job description.

Use LLM (openAI APIs) to extract: Tech skills, Soft skills, Responsibilities, Frequency of keywords, (I will provide multiple sample job descriptions for analysis/test in the data folder) 
Output: JSON of categorized keywords.

🔹 Module 2: Resume Keyword Matcher
Purpose: Compare user’s resume against extracted keywords.

Features:
paste user resume.

Use LLM (openAI APIs) to parse resume, and compare keywords vs resume content.

Output:

Keywords covered, Keywords missing, Recommendations for additions

🔹 Module 3: Resume Sections Generator
Purpose: Auto-generate or rewrite Skills, Experience, and Projects sections.

Features:

Use job-aligned keywords to:

Fill in "Skills" section (List relevant technical keywords (from master keyword list) with relevance ranking)

Generate work experience bullet points with: Action verbs, Quantified results (%, $, #), Relevant job keywords, Concise 1–2 line format per point, Structure: [Company] | [Title] | [Location] | [Dates])

Rewrite project descriptions using job-relevant language (Highlight tech used and outcomes (user engagement, accuracy, etc.)

Optional: Explain relevance to target job)

🔹 Module 4: Education & Extras Builder
Purpose: Recommend or format Education, Certifications, Languages, etc.

Features:

Offer course/Certifications suggestions if user lacks required skills

🔹 Module 5: Formatting & ATS Checker
Purpose: Ensure the resume is fully ATS-compliant.

Features:

Resume Structure & Formatting

Contact Header includes: Name, location (city, state), phone, email, LinkedIn (GitHub optional).

Optimize for ATS Parsing

Include month/year in employment dates.

Use tools or ChatGPT to check ATS compliance.
(later for enhancement; Only use 1 page, focusing on the most relevant and impactful information)

LLM or regex-based checker

Output compliance score + suggestions

🔹 Module 6: Final Resume Assembler
Purpose: Combine all components into a clean .docx or .pdf.

Features:

Allow user edits and Create a feedback interface for collecting user manual chheck and corrections.

Export final document

Option to download ATS summary report

🧠 Optional: Backend & Storage
Save user profiles and master keyword lists for future use

Track past job descriptions and resumes

Integrate guidebook rules as a system prompt


List the main features for each module. Prioritize features for MVP first, test it, then enhancements module by module later.

In README, provide the recommended tech stack for each module and describe how each (or a group of them) one has been used in this project in one line(e.g., Python, FastAPI, LangChain, OpenAI, Pandas, Resume Parser libs, Frontend UI like Streamlit or React, etc.).
for installing requirement, create venv

****************************************************************************
📎 Bonus Notes
To make this even stronger long-term, consider asking later:

“Design a schema for storing reusable skills, achievements, and project descriptions for a user profile (like a resume DB).”

“Generate prompt templates for OpenAI to produce customized experience bullets based on job keywords.”
