USER COMMANDS FROM CONVERSATION
================================

1. "extract my commands in this conversation as is in a txt file"

Note: This appears to be the only direct command given by the user in this conversation. The rest of the interaction involved:
- The user requesting to build an automated resume builder using LLMs and AI strategies
- The user requesting a high-level project plan with clear milestones for six modules
- The user requesting a README with recommended tech stacks and setup instructions
- The user requesting a sample implementation scaffold for Module 1 MVP
- The user providing their OpenAI API key
- The user requesting a more structured system with outputs saved in dedicated directories
- The user requesting to use their own sample job description text files
- The user requesting test results in plain text format as well
- The user deleting some sample files

The conversation primarily involved the assistant creating and modifying files based on the user's requests rather than the user executing specific commands.
