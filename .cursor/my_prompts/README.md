## üéØ How to Use This Directory

### When to Save a Prompt
- **Effective results**: Prompts that produce high-quality outputs
- **Reusable patterns**: Prompts that work well for similar tasks
- **Time-saving**: Prompts that significantly speed up development
- **Complex tasks**: Prompts that handle difficult or multi-step processes

### How to Organize Prompts
1. **Create category folders** for different types of tasks
2. **Use descriptive filenames** that indicate the prompt's purpose
3. **Include context** about when and how to use each prompt
4. **Add examples** of successful usage
5. **Note any modifications** needed for different scenarios

### Naming Convention
- `YYYY-MM-DD_task_description.md` for date-specific prompts
- `category_task_name.md` for general prompts
- `template_task_type.md` for reusable templates

## üìù Prompt Documentation Template

When saving a prompt, include:

```markdown
# Prompt Name

## Purpose
Brief description of what this prompt does

## When to Use
- Specific scenarios where this prompt is effective
- Input requirements
- Expected output format

## Original Context
- When/why this prompt was created
- What problem it solved
- How it was used

## Prompt Template
```python
# The actual prompt code
prompt = """
Your prompt here
"""
```

## Usage Example
```python
# How to use the prompt
formatted_prompt = prompt.format(
    variable1="value1",
    variable2="value2"
)
```

## Results
- What kind of output it produces
- Quality assessment
- Any modifications needed

## Notes
- Tips for customization
- Potential improvements
- Related prompts
